# Improving Favorite Follower functionality 
Made a change in how we favorite a follower. Added a navigation bar button inside a user's information screen providing Add to Favourite functionality. The User Info screen already has a Network Call to load the user's info which the course leverages to add to the favorite in followers' screen. This reduces an extra network call in the Follower Screen. Also, it is easier to favorite followers from the follower's user profile rather than going to the user's followers' list and adding it.
